# Supply-Chain-Analytics
A UK-based online retail store has captured the sales data for different products for the period of one year (Nov 2016 to Dec 2017). The organization sells gifts primarily on the online platform. The customers who make a purchase consume directly for themselves. There are small businesses that buy in bulk and sell to other customers through the retail outlet channel. Analysis information: Find the significant customers for the business who make high purchases of their favorite products.

#Objective:
The organization wants to roll out an offer to the high-value customers after identification of segments.

#EDA,Visualization, Model Building & Model Deployment
Use the clustering methodology to segment customers into groups: • Use the following clustering algorithms:
o K means
o Hierarchical
• Identify the right number of customer segments
• Provide the number of customers who are highly valued
• Identify the clustering algorithm that gives maximum accuracy and explains robust clusters.
• If the number of observations is loaded in one of the clusters, break down that cluster further
using clustering algorithm.
